Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.
### Variable Declaration
- Prefer the `var` statement over `define variable` when declaring variables in ABL code.

### Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variable names in ABL code.
- Never use hyphens (`-`) in variable names.

### Keyword and Style Conventions
- Use lowercase ABL keywords (e.g., `class`, `interface`, `define`, `method`, `property`, etc.).

### General Guidelines
When contributing to this project, please adhere to the following guidelines:
1. **Project Structure**: Understand the overall structure of the project, including key directories and files. This will help in navigating the codebase and making informed decisions.

2. **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding standards and best practices for the programming languages and frameworks used in the project. This includes naming conventions, code organization, and documentation requirements.

3. **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. Familiarize yourself with the ABLUnit testing framework and tools used in the project. Syntax for ABLUnit can be found in the OpenEdge MCP collection "12.8"

4. **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of your code changes. Optimize algorithms and data structures where necessary, and be mindful of memory usage and execution time.

5. **Security**: Keep security best practices in mind when writing code. Validate user input, sanitize outputs, and be aware of common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

6. **Collaboration**: Communicate effectively with team members and stakeholders. Provide clear explanations for your code changes and be open to feedback.

7. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect code changes. This includes inline comments, README files, and any relevant design documents.

8. **Version Control**: Use version control (e.g., Git) effectively. Write meaningful commit messages and follow the branching strategy defined by the project.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can help ensure that your contributions are valuable and aligned with the project's goals.
